## Why's This Necessary? ðŸ¤”

**TLDR**: _Do you feel EXPOSED when ppl peep your chat history? Then this is for you._

I've noticed when people share their screens on YT videos, live calls, or streaming - they often rush to close their ChatGPT history pane. It's not a huge deal, but let's be real: some people just don't want to broadcast their curious thoughts to the world. Or maybe they're building something in stealth.

So Peekaboo was born within the hour - it's a super simple, minimal solution to make that easier. No more scrambling to close tabs before you share your screen or need to stave off inquisitive eyes in public. Tell them to gtfo.
