# Peekaboo: ChatGPT Privacy Enhancer ðŸ‘€ðŸ”’

ðŸ‘‹ Sup welcome to **Peekaboo**, a tiny Chrome extension that keeps your ChatGPT history private in the simplest, sleekest way possible.

## Why Is This Necessary? ðŸ¤”

I've noticed when people share their screens on YT videos, live calls, or streaming - they often rush to close their ChatGPT history pane. It's not a huge deal, but let's be real: some people just don't want to broadcast their curious thoughts to the world. Or maybe they're building something in stealth.

So Peekaboo was born within the hour - it's a super simple, minimal solution to make that easier. No more scrambling to close tabs before you share your screen or need to stave off inquisitive eyes in public. Tell them to gtfo.

## What Does Peekaboo Do?

Peekaboo automatically **blurs your ChatGPT history items**, keeping your chat topics tastefully hidden.

Hover over any blurred conversation to reveal it when you need it.

## How to Get Started ðŸš€

1. **Install the Extension**: Add Peekaboo from the Chrome Web Store: [link here](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/peekaboo-chatgpt-privacy/mloaapjbhaopofjpcihoacjanjdejmcg).

## Privacy ðŸ”’

This extension **doesn't collect, store, or share any of your data**.

Yes, thereâ€™s a scary popup that says the extension can read and change your data. This just means it can access the page content to blur the html elements (check the code!).

All processing happens locally on your device, and no data is collected, stored, or shared.
